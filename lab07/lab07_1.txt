Questions

a) Exercise 1

        cities['Exercise 1'] = cities['Area square miles'].apply(lambda val: val > 50) &
                          cities['City name'].apply(lambda name: name.startswith('San'))

   Exercise 2

        New rows were creates for all of the indices that were out of range and they were filled with NaN values for
        each attribute.

b) Pandas makes it very easy to manipulate the data in intuitive ways, because it has dataframes and series. It also
   includes built in functions that make it very easy to modify only specific parts of the data.

c) Reshuffling of reordering the series in the dataframe would be helpful when data needs to be randomized because
   you can use numpy to randomly list the series. It is also helpful if the data needs to be sorted a certain way.
   Randomization is helpful for removing bias that comes from the way the data is ordered.
