Questions

a) Categorical data is textual data, while numerical data is data that is a number (which makes sense because it's
   called numerical). It's basically just qualitative and quantitative data, respectively.

b) Task 1:

        train_model(
            learning_rate=0.00005,
            steps=200,
            batch_size=5
        )

        Final RMSE (on training data): 167.19

    Task 2:

        train_model(
            learning_rate=0.00005,
            steps=200,
            batch_size=5,
            input_feature="population"
        )

        Final RMSE (on training data): 176.10

c) The hyper-parameters learning in this section are learning rate, steps, and batch size. There is not a single
   heuristic that will consistently be successful in fine tuning because the hyper-parameters are data-specific. For
   example, the exercise tells us that it is often helpful to increase the learning rate (which should make the
   training error decrease faster), but also if the learning rate is too high it can give us the opposite result from
   what we want. Also, small batch sizes can cause instability (so I used 200).
