Questions

b) i) the gps problem solver is implemented as a function
   ii) the initial states, goal states, and operators are list types
   iii) the mechanism is recursive. it examines each operator to find the one that contains the specified goal-state in its add-on list

d) i) this code models the famous mokey/banana problem where there's a monkey and a bunch of bananas in a room and the monkey wants to get the bananas but the bananas are hanging from the ceiling. there's also a chair in the room that the monkey can stand on to reach the bananas. the rules are that the monkey has to figure out how to get to the bananas by using the objects in the room
   ii) the gps mechanism solves this problem by taking in the initial states, goal state, and actions in and recursively going through the initial states (which are changed each time because of the add-ons) to see if there is a path to the goal state. if there's not a path to the goal state then it will say that there is a plan failure.
   iii) I believe that this would be artificially intelligent code. It would fall under the Thinking Rationally or Acting Rationally definitions. The purpose of the Monkey-Banana problem was to figure out if monkeys are intelligent or not. Poole 1998 said, "Computational Intelligence is the study of the design of intelligent agents," which falls into the Acting Rationally category. On the other hand, Winston 1992 said AI is "the study of the computations that make it possible to perceive, reason, and act," and Charniak and McDermott 1985 said it's "the study of mental faculties through the use of computational methods," which both fall into the Thinking Rationally Category. So I think that it could be either of these definitions but more-so the Thinking Rationally definition.
   iv) I think a monkey that solves the problem in real life would be displaying intelligence.
