    "## 1.1 The earliest psychologists studied the human mind using introspection. Would this be a good way for researchers to gain insight into human cognitive processes for the purpose of modelling those processes?\n",
    "\n",
    "I think that introspection can be a good method of figuring out some ways that the mind stores and retrieves information, but I don't think that any algorithm will ever be able to come anywhere close to being as intricate and as complex as the human brain is. The human brain does more than just perform a series of actions. In my philosophy class last semester, we talked about act-based and agent based morality. Someone who lives a agent-based moral life doesn't just have a file cabinet full of different scenarios and their corresponding moral responses. Instead, doing the moral thing is simply second nature. They don't have to dig around and find what the \"correct\" response is. They can just do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how I think of artificial intelligence. Many people think that there will be robots at some point that will have human emotion and feel and basically be human (just a programmed one). We talked about something similar in my Perspectives in Computing class. We were talking about how this one Christian programmer believes that the ethical thing to do is to build bots that will go into war instead of humans because they can be rational and ethical and aren't swayed by emotions. But how can a robot be able to make a decision like that? There are just so many factors and, sure, it will be safer for the people sending the robots because they won't be sending men into the line of fire, but I don't see how it will be good and successful in the long run.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think that introspection can help model ASPECTS of human cognitive processes, but I don't believe that it can ever come to the point where a computer can actually fully think and behave like a human does."

    "The hill-climbing method consistently gives me a worse value than the simulated annealing method. However, sometimes the values are not too different. Also, simulated annealing consistently gives me a value of 20, whereas hill-climbing gives a value in the range of -20 to -30. Neither of the methods ever succeed in getting me to my goal state (even after running it a bazillion times). Maybe my_route was too far off of the actual best route for it to reach the goal state. I'm kind of disappointed and I'm not sure if it's not working because of my code or if it's from something else. (Also it's a pretty simple graph that I'm using, so maybe it would be different if things were more complex.)"
