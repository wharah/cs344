Questions

a) FTRL is can change the learning rate whenever. It has a base learning-rate that is specified and can then be
   adjusted based off the coefficients used for training.ss

b) Binning and bucketing is useful because it turns linear variables into discrete variables. This means that
   variables that don'thave a linear relationship with the target can still be related. It's the same reason that a
   synthetic feature was created in part 2. Also in binning each bin can have a distinct weight.

c) Task 1: def createBucket(feature, featureStr, buckets):
               tf.feature_column.bucketized_column(
                   feature, boundaries=get_quantile_based_boundaries(
                       training_examples[featureStr], buckets
                   )
               )

           bucketized_latitude = createBucket(latitude, "latitude", 10)
           bucketized_housing_median_age = createBucket(housing_median_age, "housing_median_age", 10)
           bucketized_median_income = createBucket(median_income, "median_income", 10)
           bucketized_rooms_per_person = createBucket(rooms_per_person, "rooms_per_person", 10)

   Task 2: long_x_lat = tf.feature_column.crossed_column(
               set([bucketized_longitude, bucketized_latitude]), hash_bucket_size=1000
           )
