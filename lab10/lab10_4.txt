Questions

a)   i) There are 1000 cat images and 1000 dog images, each of which is 150x150 pixels.

    ii) The first CNN has one more MaxPooling layer than ours did in class. There are also more nodes per layer in the
        first CNN compared to the one we did in class. They both rely on a ReLU activation function.

   iii) The intermediate representations aren't that discernible to the human eye. At the beginning they started out
        being recognizable as cats but then turn into what seems to be randomly colored pixels.
