Questions

a) I would rather use Keras to build my models because it is simpler and more intuitive to use. I think Tensorflow
   offers more but I don't know how to use it very well at this point so I'd choose Keras.

b) Task 1: learning_rate = 0.001
           steps = 2000
           batch_size = 250

           Final RMSE (on training data): 103.74
           Final RMSE (on validation data): 102.91

   Task 2: Final RMSE (on test data): 112.73
