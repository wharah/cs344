Questions

a) In this example, the confusion matrix shows which numbers are commonly misclassified as each other. It shows those
   that were correctly classified as well as those that were incorrectly classified.

b) The Tensorflow network has two hidden layers. Both layers have 100 nodes and use a ReLU activation function whereas
   Keras also has two hidden layers but one has 512 nodes and a ReLU activation function and the other has just 10
   nodes and uses the SoftMax activation function. I didn't see any ways I could improve the baseline testset
   accuracy.

c) With only ten steps, the images are super grainy and pixelated and the colors are pretty random. With higher steps,
   partial numbers and patterns are discernible even though it's still a bit grainy.
