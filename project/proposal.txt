I plan to use tensorflow and keras to create a convolutional neural network that will recognize different types oflunar rocks. 
I want to use a dataset of artificial rocky lunar landscape renders from Romain Pessia on kaggle to train the model. 
The dataset contains 9,766 images.

Here is the link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/romainpessia/artificial-lunar-rocky-landscape-dataset

This interests me because I am studying astronomy and while my research is on binary stars, one of the most prominent
astronomical objects that we look at during local observing is the moon. I have tons of images on my phone of the moon that 
I've taken through our telescope and they're too far away to be able to see any individual rocks, so I think it will be cool 
to use these rock renderings to be able to classify real rock images.
