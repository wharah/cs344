I plan to use tensorflow and keras to create a convolutional neural network that will recognize different types of
lunar rocks. I want to use a dataset of artificial rocky lunar landscape renders from Romain Pessia on kaggle to 
train the model. The dataset contains 9,766 images.

Here is the link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/romainpessia/artificial-lunar-rocky-landscape-dataset
