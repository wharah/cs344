I plan to use tensorflow and keras to create a convolutional neural network that will recognize different types oflunar 
rocks. I want to use a dataset of artificial rocky lunar landscape renders from Romain Pessia on kaggle to train the model. 
I will only be using the iamges from the "render" folder (the iamges in the other two folders are what were used to create 
the renders. The dataset contains 9,766 images. 

Here is the link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/romainpessia/artificial-lunar-rocky-landscape-dataset

This interests me because I am studying astronomy and while my research is on binary stars, one of the most prominent
astronomical objects that we look at during local observing is the moon. I really love the moon and I have tons of images 
on my phone of the moon that I've taken through our telescope and they're too far away to be able to see any individual 
rocks, so I think it will be cool to use these artificial rock renderings to be able to classify real rock images.
