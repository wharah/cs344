I plan to use tensorflow and keras to create a convolutional neural network that will recognize different types of birds. 
I have found a dataset online at kaggle.com. The images are already divided into folders that describe them as test, train,
and validation.

Here is the link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/gpiosenka/100-bird-species

This isn't super interesting to me but I originally wanted to do something related to astronomy and couldn't find a single
dataset that was already tagged. It could be useful for new birdwatchers who want to catch some birds on camera and identify 
them. I'm hoping that I'll be able to figure out a network that is fast and accurate.
