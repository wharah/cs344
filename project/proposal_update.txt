Vision

  My vision is to create a convolutional neural network that will accurately identify different types of rocks on the moon.
  The clean and round images show the four classes of objects that were used to make the renderings. They include the sky
  (red), large rocks (blue), and small rocks (green). This allows for all of teh rocks to be labelled for the training 
  without me having to go through and manually tag everything (which I am thankful for).
