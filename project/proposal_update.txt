Vision

  My vision is to create a convolutional neural network that will accurately identify difference bird species. This is not
  what I originally wanted to do but I was unable to find suitable data for astronomy that was already pretagged. This
  project is still interesting to me, though, because if I ever take a picture of one of these birds and didn't know what 
  was, I could run it through this program and find out. This would be very helpful for me because I know very little about
  birds but I want to know. Earlier this semester I bought bird seed and like watching birds come to eat it but I never
  know what species they are!
  
Background

  In this project I am creating a CNN that takes in 27,503 training images, 1,000 testing images, and 1,000 validation 
  images. Since I am using images from my own directory I will use keras' flow_from_directory() function to create usable 
  datasets. I have tried to use Conv2D and MaxPooling to get good accuracy with my image recognition but I have had no such 
  luck.

Implementation

  

Implications

  This kind of software (if it ever works) would be very helpful for birdwatchers because if they don't know what a bird is,
  they can feed the picture into this program and find out!
