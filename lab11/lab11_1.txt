Questions

a) Yes. Linear models could be preferable because they train faster and perform better on some data than a deep neural
   network might. It's best to use linear models on data that doesn't display any sorts of non-linear behavior.

b) The neural network does perform better than the linear model. It produced about 10% higher accuracy values than the
   linear model did.

c) Embeddings didn't change much for the sentiment analysis tasks. The accuracy remained around 78% for both the
   training and testing sets, which is about the same as the linear model.

d) The words enjoyed and loved have very similar embeddings and this makes sense because they essentially mean the
   same thing.

e) The best performance I got was when I used a learning_rate of 0.05, trained with 5000 steps, and used 25x25 hidden
   units. It gave an accuracy of 0.94 on the training set and 87% on the testing set.
