Questions

a) The largest bias I see represented by this data is in the gender. 2/3 of the people are men and only 1/3 is women.
   Usually you would want things to be about 50/50 between the two of those.

b) I looked at gender on the axis with color separation by occupation. I noticed that there was a large amount of men
   who do "craft repair" and hardly any women with the same occupation. There was also a large amount of women who were
   admin/clerical while there weren't a lot of men in the same occupation.

c) Done

d) Race                 Precision   Recall      False Positive Rate
   White                0.6983      0.5793      0.0878
   Black                0.6328      0.4821      0.0378
   Asian-Pac-Islander   0.6944      0.6198      0.1150
   Amer-Indian-Eskimo   0.6875      0.5789      0.0385
   Other                0.7500      0.3750      0.0306

   The model performs best for the White and Asian-Pac-Islander subgroups (except Asian-Pac-Islander also has the
   largest false-positive rate) and it doesn't do as well for as well for the Black and Amer-Indian-Eskimo subgroups.
   The best performing one is actually the Other subgroup, though, with 75% precision, 37.5% recall, and with a
   false-positive rate of only 3.06%.
