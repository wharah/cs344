Questions

a) Sparsity simplifies the model by decreasing the number of parameters needed. This helps it avoid overfitting.

b) L1 increases sparsity because it encourages more parameters to go to 0. This allows the model to have even less
   parameters that play a role.

c) Task 1: Model Size: 631
           Regularization Strength: 0.5
           LogLoss at period 06: 0.25
